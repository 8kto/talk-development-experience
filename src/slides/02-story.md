# Story
For now I use Linux for last 10 years, maybe a bit more. I tried a various set of distros and desktop environments, as

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-half">
    <h2>Distros</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>CentOS (~5 years)</li>
      <li>ArchLinux (1 year)</li>
      <li>Mageia (1-2 years)</li>
      <li>OpenSuse (most of the time)</li>
      <li>Ubuntu (1.5 year)</li>
    </ul> 
  </div>
  <div class="col-half">
    <h2>DE</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>KDE (episodically during a couple of years)</li>
      <li>Gnome (most of the time)</li>
      <li>LXDE (episodically)</li>
      <li>XFCE (3+ years, as a personal protest against the 3rd Gnome)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

From the above I can say with confidence: Ubuntu + Gnome just works :D

It is stable, there are tons of software/packages, it is easy to use and configure.
