# Git
Another everyday tool â€” `git`. Let's add some hacky aliases to provide more awesomeness.

# Git hooks

**What are Git hooks?**

Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as: commit, push, and receive (pull). 
Git hooks are a built-in feature - no need to download anything. Git hooks are run locally.


---
Some example hook scripts include:
+ `pre-commit`: Check the commit message for spelling errors.
+ `pre-receive`: Enforce project coding standards.
+ `post-commit`: Email/SMS team members of a new commit.
+ `post-receive`: Push the code to production.

# Committing code
Why `vim` on commit:
+ I use git in a command line, so it is more natural and saves an additional `Alt+Tab` for switching into IDE or an external GUI tool
+ it ables you to autocomplete words __out of the box__.


---
Another small script eases tedious committing of not-so-important files.
