# Intro

Recently I discovered a `DX` term - which means Development eXpirience. 
This all is about the stuff behind the code you're writing: physical and software environment, tooling and so on.

I was fascinated by this term, and pleasantly surprised because I've been collecting such tips/tricks/notes and environment adjustments for some time.
