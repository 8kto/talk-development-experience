# Gnome tweaks

However, to improve some clumsy parts of `Gnome` install [Gnome Tweaks Tool](https://itsfoss.com/gnome-tweak-tool/). 

I guess there is nothing to advice: just tune it to your taste 

(also be sure to check some top extensions list like [this](https://www.fossmint.com/best-gnome-shell-extensions/) or [this](https://itsfoss.com/best-gnome-extensions/)).
